# IDEAS

This is a collection of ideas for enhancements, tests, and play mechanics. Mark off items that are complete, and cross out items that we are ignoring.

# Web interface

## Look and feel

- [ ] Main logo should be larger and centred in the terminal
- [ ] The terminal width should be limited to 100 characters, centred on the page
- [ ] Placeholders should be added to the right of the terminal, for future dashboards and status (1/4 of the width or less)
