## Design Philosophy

The design has been consolidated to focus on two key audiences:

1. **Developers** need technical implementation details â†’ **SYSTEM-DESIGN.md**
2. **Players/Testers** need gameplay understanding â†’ **GAME-GUIDE.md**

This consolidation removes redundancy while preserving all essential information in a more accessible format.

## Wireframes

The `wireframes/` directory contains visual design mockups and interface layouts that supported the development process.
