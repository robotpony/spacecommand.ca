- **Energy**: Powers (shields, weapons, industrial facilities)
- **Raw Materials**: Mining output (ship/structure construction)
- **Food**: Sustains (population growth, military morale)
- **Technology Points**: Research advancement currency

### Resource Mechanics
- **Production**: Based on planet specialization and buildings
- **Consumption**: Fleet maintenance, population support, research
- **Storage**: Limited capacity, overflow penalties
- **Trade**: Player-to-player resource exchange
- **Market**: AI-controlled supply/demand pricing

## Empire Management

### Planet Specialization
- **Mining**: +50% raw materials, -25% food production
- **Energy**: +50% energy, -25% raw materials production  
- **Agricultural**: +50% food, +25% population growth
- **Research**: +50% technology points, -25% raw materials
- **Industrial**: +50% construction speed, +25% raw materials
- **Fortress**: +100% defensive bonus, -50% resource production
- **Balanced**: No bonuses or penalties

### Building System
- **Resource Extractors**: Boost specialized resource production
- **Population Centers**: Increase population capacity and growth
- **Research Labs**: Generate technology points
- **Shipyards**: Construct and maintain fleets
- **Defensive Structures**: Planetary shields and weapon systems

### Technology Tree
- **Tier 1**: Basic improvements (10% production bonuses)
- **Tier 2**: Advanced systems (ship upgrades, new buildings)
- **Tier 3**: Specialized technologies (planet terraforming)
- **Tier 4**: Strategic capabilities (long-range sensors, diplomacy)
- **Tier 5**: Game-changing technologies (mega-structures)

## Military & Combat

### Fleet Composition
- **Scouts**: Fast, cheap, weak (exploration, reconnaissance)
- **Fighters**: Fast, moderate cost/strength (harassment, support)
- **Frigates**: Balanced cost/speed/strength (general purpose)
- **Destroyers**: Slow, expensive, strong (heavy combat)
- **Cruisers**: Moderate stats, special abilities (command, support)
- **Battleships**: Slowest, most expensive, strongest (capital ships)
- **Carriers**: Launch fighter squadrons (force multipliers)

### Combat Mechanics
- **Initiative**: Scouts > Fighters > Frigates > Destroyers > Cruisers > Battleships > Carriers
- **Weapon Effectiveness**: Ship-type bonuses/penalties vs targets
- **Battle Rounds**: Initiative-based with simultaneous damage
- **Morale System**: Affects combat performance and retreat probability
- **Experience**: Veterans gain combat bonuses over time

### Attack Types
- **Conventional**: Standard fleet vs fleet combat
- **Covert**: Stealth attacks with limited forces
- **Orbital Bombardment**: Destroy planet infrastructure
- **Blockade**: Prevent resource production/trade

## Diplomacy & Politics

### Diplomatic Relations
- **Trust Levels**: -100 (war) to +100 (close allies)
- **Relationship Types**: War, Hostile, Neutral, Friendly, Allied
- **Reputation**: Galaxy-wide standing affects all relations

### Agreement Types
- **Non-Aggression Pacts**: Prevent direct military action
- **Trade Agreements**: Resource exchange with bonuses
- **Military Alliances**: Mutual defense obligations
- **Research Partnerships**: Shared technology development
- **Intelligence Sharing**: Sensor data and reconnaissance

### Diplomatic Actions
- **Proposals**: Formal diplomatic offers
- **Messages**: Private communication between players
- **Sanctions**: Economic penalties for hostile actions
- **Espionage**: Intelligence gathering and sabotage
- **Mediation**: Third-party conflict resolution

## Territory & Expansion

### Galaxy Structure
- **Sectors**: 100 total sectors in 10x10 grid
- **Planets**: 1-5 planets per sector
- **Resources**: Sector-specific resource bonuses
- **Strategic Value**: Central sectors worth more points

### Exploration Mechanics
- **Sensor Range**: Limited by technology and fleet position
- **Exploration Costs**: Action points and fleet movement
- **Discovery Rewards**: New planets, resources, artifacts
- **Fog of War**: Limited information outside sensor range

### Colonization Process
- **Requirements**: Population, resources, transport capacity
- **Costs**: Varies by planet type and distance
- **Time**: Multi-turn process vulnerable to disruption
- **Success Factors**: Technology, resources, diplomatic status

### Trade Routes
- **Establishment**: Connect friendly planets/empires
- **Benefits**: Resource bonuses, diplomatic bonuses
- **Vulnerability**: Can be disrupted by hostile fleets
- **Maintenance**: Requires ongoing investment

## Game Balance Systems

### Action Point Economy
- **Standard Actions**: 1 point (move fleet, basic construction)
- **Complex Actions**: 2-3 points (attack, major construction)
- **Emergency Actions**: 5 points (rapid deployment, crisis response)
- **Diplomatic Actions**: Variable cost (1-3 points)

### Anti-Cheat Systems
- **Resource Validation**: Impossible production/consumption blocked
- **Fleet Verification**: Ship counts and compositions verified
- **Turn Sequence**: Actions must follow proper game phases
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents automated advantage exploitation

### Difficulty Scaling
