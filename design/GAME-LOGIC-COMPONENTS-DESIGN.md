# Game Logic Components Design

## Overview

The Game Logic Components form the core business logic layer that orchestrates all game mechanics in SpaceCommand. These components handle turn management, resource calculations, combat resolution, diplomacy processing, territory expansion, game balance validation, and anti-cheat systems - essentially all the game rules and mechanics that make the game function as a robust, production-ready system.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Service-Oriented Design
- Each component is a self-contained service with clear responsibilities
- Components communicate through well-defined interfaces
- Loose coupling allows for independent testing and modification
- No direct database access - all operations go through models

### 2. Transaction Safety
- All state-changing operations are atomic using database transactions
- Action point consumption is validated and reserved before processing
- Rollback mechanisms for failed operations
- Consistent game state maintained across all operations

### 3. Real-Time Processing
- Components designed for both scheduled (turn-based) and real-time processing
- Event-driven architecture for immediate feedback
- Smart caching strategy with event-based invalidation
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates

### 4. Game Integrity
- Comprehensive validation framework for all game actions
- Anti-cheat systems to prevent exploitation
- Game balance enforcement through rule engines
- Performance monitoring and circuit breakers for resilience

## Core Components

### 1. Game Balance Engine (`src/server/services/GameBalanceEngine.js`)

**Purpose**: Validates all game actions against balance rules and prevents exploitative behavior.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Validate action costs and resource requirements
- Prevent exploitative player behaviors
- Ensure fair gameplay mechanics
- Handle edge cases like resource overflow or underflow
- Enforce game rules and constraints

**Core Methods**:
```javascript
class GameBalanceEngine {
    /**
     * Validates a player action against game balance rules
     * @param {number} playerId - Player ID
     * @param {Object} action - Proposed action
     * @param {Object} gameState - Current game state
     * @returns {Object} Validation result with any rule violations
     */
    async validateAction(playerId, action, gameState)

    /**
     * Checks if resource costs are within acceptable limits
     * @param {Object} costs - Resource costs
     * @param {Object} context - Action context
     * @returns {boolean} Whether costs are balanced
     */
    validateResourceCosts(costs, context)

    /**
     * Prevents resource overflow and underflow scenarios
     * @param {number} empireId - Empire ID
     * @param {Object} resourceChanges - Proposed resource changes
     * @returns {Object} Adjusted resource changes within limits
     */
    enforceResourceLimits(empireId, resourceChanges)
}
```

**Balance Rules**:
- Maximum resource accumulation limits
- Minimum viable empire thresholds
- Action cost scaling based on empire size
- Time-based action restrictions
- Resource conversion rate limits

### 2. Turn Management System (`src/server/services/TurnManager.js`)

- Process end-of-turn calculations (resource production, fleet movement, etc.)
- Handle turn deadlines and automated processing
- Manage emergency action system for critical situations
- Process partial turn states when players are offline
- Handle cross-turn dependencies and rollback scenarios

**Core Methods**:
```javascript
class TurnManager {
    /**
     * Advances to the next turn and processes all end-of-turn events
     * @returns {Object} Turn advancement results
     */
    async advanceTurn()

    /**
     * Processes all scheduled events for the current turn
     * @returns {Array} List of processed events
     */
    async processScheduledEvents()

    /**
     * Validates and consumes action points for a player action
     * @param {number} playerId - Player ID
     * @param {number} cost - Action point cost
     * @returns {boolean} Whether points were successfully consumed
     */

     * Manages partial turn processing for offline players
     * @param {Array} offlinePlayerIds - List of offline player IDs
     * @returns {Object} Partial turn processing results
     */
    async processPartialTurns(offlinePlayerIds)

     * @param {number} empireId - Empire ID
     * @param {Object} shortages - Resource shortage data
     * @returns {Object} Rationing plan and effects
     */
    async implementEmergencyRationing(empireId, shortages)

     * @param {number} empireId - Empire ID
     * @param {Array} interruptedRoutes - List of interrupted trade routes
     * @returns {Object} Resource impact analysis
     */
    async processTradeInterruptions(empireId, interruptedRoutes)
}
```

     * @returns {Object} Weighted action impact
     */
    applyHistoricalWeighting(player1Id, player2Id, action)
}
```

**Enhanced Relationship Mechanics**:

     * @returns {Object} Dispute resolution options and outcomes
     */
    processTerritorialDispute(empire1Id, empire2Id, disputedTerritory)
}
```

**Enhanced Spatial Mechanics**:
- Grid-based galaxy with sectors, systems, and precise coordinates
- FTL travel vs. sublight with fuel consumption and maintenance costs
- Territory influence zones with gradual borders, not hard boundaries
- Trade route security affected by patrol presence and piracy activity

## Integration Architecture

### Component Interaction Flow

1. **API Endpoint** receives request and validates authentication
2. **Game State Middleware** validates action points and game state
3. **Resource Authorization** validates ownership and permissions
4. **Game Logic Component** processes the core business logic
5. **Model Layer** persists changes to database
6. **Event Queue** schedules notifications and follow-up events
7. **WebSocket** sends real-time updates to affected players

### Transaction Management

All game logic operations use database transactions:

```javascript
// Example transaction pattern
async function performGameAction(playerId, actionData) {
    const transaction = await db.beginTransaction();
    try {
        // 1. Validate prerequisites
        await validateAction(playerId, actionData, transaction);
        
        // 2. Reserve action points
        await gameState.consumeActionPoints(playerId, actionCost, transaction);
        
        // 3. Process game logic
        const result = await gameLogicComponent.processAction(actionData, transaction);
        
        // 4. Update database
        await persistResults(result, transaction);
        
        // 5. Schedule events
        await eventQueue.scheduleEvents(result.events, transaction);
        
        await transaction.commit();
        return result;
    } catch (error) {
        await transaction.rollback();
        throw error;
    }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Enhanced Caching Strategy
- **Smart Cache Invalidation**: Event-based cache invalidation instead of time-based
- **Empire resource totals**: Cached until resource-affecting events occur
- **Combat calculations**: Cached during active battles, invalidated on battle completion
- **Diplomatic relationship data**: Cached until diplomatic actions occur
- **Territory maps**: Cached until colonization, exploration, or territorial changes
- **AI decision cache**: Cache AI calculations for 1 hour to prevent repeated expensive operations
- **Game state snapshots**: Cache complete game state snapshots for 15 minutes for consistency

### Database Optimization
- **Spatial indexes**: PostGIS extension for efficient territory and distance queries
- **Composite indexes**: Multi-column indexes for complex queries (empire+resource+time)
- **Partitioned tables**: Partition large tables by empire or time for better performance
- **Materialized views**: Pre-calculated aggregations for leaderboards and statistics
- **Batch processing**: Bulk operations for turn advancement and resource calculations
- **Connection pooling**: Advanced connection pooling with read/write splitting
- **Query optimization**: Specific query patterns for each game logic component

### Scalability Design
- **Microservice architecture**: Each game logic component can be horizontally scaled
- **Event queue clustering**: Distributed event processing with Redis Cluster
- **Database read replicas**: Read-only replicas for query scaling
- **Circuit breakers**: Prevent cascading failures between components
- **Load balancing**: Intelligent load balancing based on empire activity
