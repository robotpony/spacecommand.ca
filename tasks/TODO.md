- Added subtle borders and spacing for organization
- Preserved all accessibility features and animations

### Expected User Experience Impact

- **Professional Appearance**: Larger logo and organized layout create better first impression
- **Improved Readability**: 100-character width limit makes terminal output more readable
- **Future Expansion**: Dashboard panels provide clear space for game status widgets
- **Responsive Design**: Layout adapts gracefully across all device sizes
- **Functional Preservation**: All existing game commands and features remain intact
