# Project Setup Tasks

## Infrastructure Setup Phase

### Core Project Setup
- [x] Initialize Node.js project with npm init
- [x] Set up basic Express server structure in `bin/server.js`
- [x] Create React frontend scaffolding in `src/client/`
- [x] Add development infrastructure (.gitignore, basic file structure)
- [x] Set up Jest testing framework

### Directory Structure
- [x] Create `src/server/` for Express server components
- [x] Create `src/client/` for React frontend components
- [x] Create `src/shared/` for shared utilities/types
- [x] Create `tests/` directory for test files

### Documentation
- [ ] Create basic README.md with project overview
- [ ] Create DESIGN.md for overall design rules

## Notes
- Game logic and RESTful API endpoints will be designed separately after infrastructure setup
- Focus on getting foundational project structure ready for design phase
- Keep all changes simple and minimal
