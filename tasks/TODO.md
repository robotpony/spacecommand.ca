- [ ] Create Player model with authentication (`src/server/models/Player.js`)
- [ ] Create Combat model for battle resolution (`src/server/models/Combat.js`)
- [ ] Create Diplomacy model for inter-player relations (`src/server/models/Diplomacy.js`)

### Database Layer
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL connection and configuration
- [ ] Create database schema migration files
- [ ] Implement base model class with CRUD operations
- [ ] Add Redis caching layer for session management
- [ ] Create database seed files for testing

### RESTful API Endpoints
- [ ] Empire management endpoints (`/api/empire`, `/api/planets`, `/api/resources`)
- [ ] Military & combat endpoints (`/api/fleets`, `/api/combat`)
- [ ] Diplomacy endpoints (`/api/diplomacy`, `/api/espionage`)
- [ ] Territory & expansion endpoints (`/api/sectors`, `/api/colonize`, `/api/trade-routes`)
- [ ] Player authentication endpoints (`/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`)

- [ ] Implement core commands (status, scan, move, attack, build, trade, research)
- [ ] Add command history and autocomplete functionality
- [ ] Create session management for persistent connections
- [ ] Add real-time update notifications via WebSocket

### API Integration
- [ ] HTTP client for RESTful API communication
- [ ] Authentication token management
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Response formatting for terminal display
- [ ] WebSocket client for real-time updates

### Testing Framework
- [ ] Unit tests for command parsing
- [ ] Integration tests for API communication
- [ ] End-to-end tests for complete game scenarios
- [ ] Performance tests for concurrent player simulation

## Phase 3: Basic Web REPL Client (Browser)

### Web Terminal Interface
- [ ] Create browser-based terminal component using React
- [ ] Implement command input with history and autocomplete
- [ ] Add syntax highlighting for commands
- [ ] Create responsive terminal layout
- [ ] Add WebSocket connection for real-time updates

### UI Components
- [ ] Empire status dashboard
- [ ] Galaxy map visualization
- [ ] Fleet management interface
- [ ] Diplomacy message center
- [ ] Resource management panel
- [ ] Combat log viewer

### Frontend Architecture
- [ ] State management with React Context or Redux
