## Review Section

### Phase 1 Core Data Models - COMPLETED
**Summary**: Successfully created all 6 core data models for the SpaceCommand game:

2. **Planet.js** - Specialization system with 7 different planet types, building management, and production bonuses
3. **Fleet.js** - Unit composition system with 7 ship types, combat stats, and fleet operations
4. **Player.js** - Authentication system with session management, profiles, settings, and permissions
5. **Combat.js** - Battle resolution system with round-based combat, damage calculation, and morale effects
6. **Diplomacy.js** - Inter-player relations with proposals, agreements, trade routes, and trust levels
