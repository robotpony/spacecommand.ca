# Player Authentication REST Interface - Task Plan

**Project**: SpaceCommand.ca  
**Focus**: Player Signup and Sign-in REST API Implementation  
**Date**: 2025-07-18  

## Overview

This task plan focuses exclusively on implementing a robust REST API for player authentication, including signup, sign-in, session management, and related security features.

## Task List

### Phase 1: Authentication API Foundation
- [ ] **Review existing auth infrastructure** - Analyze current auth.js controller and routes (Low complexity, Low risk)
- [ ] **Audit Player model for auth requirements** - Ensure all necessary fields exist (Low complexity, Low risk)
- [ ] **Design REST endpoints specification** - Define all auth-related endpoints with request/response schemas (Medium complexity, Low risk)

### Phase 2: Core Authentication Endpoints
- [ ] **Implement POST /api/auth/signup endpoint** - Player registration with validation (Medium complexity, Medium risk)
- [ ] **Implement POST /api/auth/signin endpoint** - Player login with JWT token generation (Medium complexity, Medium risk)
- [ ] **Implement POST /api/auth/signout endpoint** - Session invalidation (Low complexity, Low risk)
- [ ] **Implement GET /api/auth/me endpoint** - Current user profile retrieval (Low complexity, Low risk)

### Phase 3: Security Implementation
- [ ] **Add input validation middleware** - Sanitize and validate all auth inputs (Medium complexity, High risk)
- [ ] **Implement rate limiting** - Prevent brute force attacks on auth endpoints (Medium complexity, Medium risk)
- [ ] **Add password strength requirements** - Enforce secure password policies (Low complexity, Low risk)
- [ ] **Implement account lockout protection** - Temporary lockout after failed attempts (Medium complexity, Medium risk)

### Phase 4: Session Management
- [ ] **Implement JWT token refresh** - Allow token renewal without re-authentication (Medium complexity, Medium risk)
- [ ] **Add session tracking** - Track active sessions per user (Medium complexity, Low risk)
- [ ] **Implement session revocation** - Allow users to invalidate all sessions (Low complexity, Low risk)
- [ ] **Add device/browser tracking** - Optional session metadata (Low complexity, Low risk)

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- [ ] **Password reset flow** - Email-based password recovery (High complexity, Medium risk)
- [ ] **Email verification** - Confirm email addresses during signup (High complexity, Medium risk)
- [ ] **Account management endpoints** - Update profile, change password (Medium complexity, Low risk)
- [ ] **Two-factor authentication setup** - Optional 2FA implementation (High complexity, High risk)

### Phase 6: Testing and Documentation
- [ ] **Unit tests for auth endpoints** - Comprehensive test coverage (Medium complexity, Low risk)
- [ ] **Integration tests for auth flow** - End-to-end authentication testing (Medium complexity, Low risk)
- [ ] **API documentation** - OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for auth endpoints (Low complexity, Low risk)
- [ ] **Security audit** - Review implementation for vulnerabilities (Medium complexity, High risk)

## Technical Requirements

### REST Endpoint Design
```
POST /api/auth/signup
POST /api/auth/signin  
POST /api/auth/signout
GET  /api/auth/me
POST /api/auth/refresh
POST /api/auth/forgot-password
POST /api/auth/reset-password
PUT  /api/auth/change-password
POST /api/auth/verify-email
```

### Security Standards
- JWT tokens with secure signing
- Bcrypt password hashing (minimum 12 rounds)
- Rate limiting (max 5 attempts per minute per IP)
- Input sanitization and validation
- HTTPS enforcement
- CSRF protection where applicable

### Data Validation
- Email format validation
- Password strength requirements (8+ chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- Username constraints (3-20 chars, alphanumeric + underscore)
- Proper error messages without information disclosure

### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": boolean,
  "data": object | null,
  "message": string,
  "errors": array | null
}
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All authentication endpoints return consistent response format
- [ ] Password security meets industry standards
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] JWT tokens are properly secured and validated
- [ ] Input validation prevents injection attacks
- [ ] Error messages are helpful but don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Session management is secure and efficient
- [ ] All endpoints have comprehensive tests
- [ ] API documentation is complete and accurate

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk Items:**
- Password security implementation
- JWT token security
- Two-factor authentication
- Email verification flow

**Medium Risk Items:**
- Rate limiting configuration
- Account lockout mechanisms
- Session management
- Password reset flow

**Low Risk Items:**
- Basic CRUD operations
- Input validation
- Response formatting
- Documentation

## Implementation Notes

- Build on existing auth infrastructure in src/server/controllers/auth.js
- Leverage existing Player model and database migrations
- Use existing middleware patterns for consistency
- Follow established error handling patterns
- Maintain compatibility with existing client interfaces

## Next Steps

1. Begin with Phase 1 task: Review existing auth infrastructure
2. Move systematically through each phase
3. Test thoroughly after each major milestone
4. Document all endpoints as they're implemented
5. Security review before considering complete
