### 🎯 Current Phase: Game Component Play Testing

## Active Tasks - Phase 4

### Balance Testing (High Priority)
- [ ] Resource production rate tuning
- [ ] Combat system balance verification
- [ ] Economic system stress testing
- [ ] Diplomacy effectiveness evaluation
- [ ] Turn timing optimization

### Gameplay Testing (High Priority)
- [ ] Single-player game flow verification
- [ ] Multi-player interaction testing
- [ ] Tutorial system development
- [ ] AI mentor system implementation
- [ ] Player progression curve analysis

### Performance Testing (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Database query optimization
- [ ] API response time testing
- [ ] Concurrent user load testing
- [ ] Memory usage optimization
- [ ] WebSocket connection stability

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Start Game Testing Server**
   ```bash
   npm start          # Start main server
   npm run terminal   # Test terminal client
   # Navigate to http://localhost:3000 for web client
   ```

2. **Create Test Scenarios**
   - Single player walkthrough
   - Multi-player combat scenarios
   - Resource economy balance tests
   - Diplomatic interaction tests

3. **Performance Baseline**
   - Measure current API response times
   - Test with multiple concurrent users
   - Profile memory usage patterns
   - Identify optimization opportunities

- [ ] Support 50+ concurrent users
- [ ] Memory usage stable over time
- [ ] Database queries optimized
- [ ] Client interfaces responsive

### User Experience
- [ ] New player onboarding smooth
- [ ] Command interface intuitive
- [ ] Error messages helpful
- [ ] Game progression engaging
- [ ] Multi-player interactions fun

## Risks and Mitigations

### Low Risk ✅
- **Technical infrastructure**: Proven and tested
- **Core game mechanics**: Well-designed and implemented
- **Security measures**: Comprehensive protection

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- **Game balance**: May need iterative tuning
- **User experience**: Requires real player feedback
- **Performance scaling**: Needs load testing validation

### Migration Strategy
If Phase 4 reveals major issues:
1. **Balance issues**: Adjust constants in service layer
2. **Performance issues**: Database query optimization
3. **UX issues**: Interface refinements without core changes
