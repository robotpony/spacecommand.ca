# Phase 4: Balance Analysis Report

**Date**: 2025-07-19  
**Status**: Initial Balance Assessment  

## Current Resource Production Baseline

### Planet Specialization Production Rates (per turn)
- **Mining Planet**: Metal: 100, Energy: 20, Food: 10, Research: 5
- **Energy Planet**: Metal: 10, Energy: 120, Food: 15, Research: 10  
- **Agricultural Planet**: Metal: 5, Energy: 25, Food: 150, Research: 5
- **Research Planet**: Metal: 15, Energy: 40, Food: 20, Research: 100
- **Industrial Planet**: Metal: 80, Energy: 60, Food: 30, Research: 20
- **Fortress Planet**: Metal: 40, Energy: 50, Food: 40, Research: 30
- **Balanced Planet**: Metal: 50, Energy: 50, Food: 50, Research: 50

### Fleet Maintenance Costs (per ship per turn)
- **Scout**: Metal: 1, Energy: 2, Food: 1
- **Fighter**: Metal: 2, Energy: 3, Food: 2
- **Corvette**: Metal: 4, Energy: 5, Food: 3
- **Destroyer**: Metal: 8, Energy: 10, Food: 6
- **Cruiser**: Metal: 15, Energy: 18, Food: 12
- **Battleship**: Metal: 30, Energy: 35, Food: 25
- **Dreadnought**: Metal: 60, Energy: 70, Food: 50

### Building Effects
- **Mining Facility**: 25% metal bonus, maintenance: Energy: 5, Food: 2
- **Power Plant**: 25% energy bonus, maintenance: Metal: 3, Food: 1
- **Agricultural Dome**: 25% food bonus, maintenance: Metal: 2, Energy: 3

## Initial Balance Assessment

### Resource Production Analysis
1. **Specialization Benefits**: Each specialized planet produces 2-3x more of its primary resource vs balanced
2. **Trade-offs**: Specialization creates strong dependencies on other planet types
3. **Metal vs Energy**: Energy planets produce 20% more of their specialty than mining planets
4. **Food Abundance**: Agricultural planets produce 50% more food than other planets produce their specialties

### Fleet Economics Analysis
1. **Maintenance Scaling**: Larger ships cost exponentially more to maintain
2. **Scout Economics**: Very cheap (4 total resources) - possibly too economical
3. **Dreadnought Cost**: Expensive (180 total resources) - need to verify production can sustain
4. **Fleet Size Impact**: Large fleets will heavily drain economy

### Potential Balance Issues Identified

#### High Priority
- [ ] **Food overproduction**: Agricultural planets may produce too much food relative to consumption
- [ ] **Scout spam potential**: Very low maintenance costs might encourage mass scout builds  
- [ ] **Dreadnought sustainability**: Need to verify if economy can sustain multiple dreadnoughts

#### Medium Priority  
- [ ] **Energy vs Metal imbalance**: Energy planets 20% more efficient than mining
- [ ] **Research bottleneck**: Research production notably lower across all planet types
- [ ] **Building bonus stacking**: Need to verify if multiple bonuses stack appropriately

## Testing Recommendations

### Phase 4A: Economic Balance Tests
1. **Single Planet Economy**: Test each planet type in isolation
2. **Fleet Sustainability**: Calculate maximum sustainable fleet sizes
3. **Resource Overflow**: Test what happens when storage limits are reached
4. **Building ROI**: Calculate return on investment for each building type

### Phase 4B: Combat Balance Tests  
1. **Ship Type Effectiveness**: Test combat outcomes for each ship type pairing
2. **Fleet Composition**: Test mixed fleets vs specialized fleets
3. **Experience Impact**: Verify veteran bonus effects on combat
4. **Technology Scaling**: Test how tech levels affect combat balance

### Phase 4C: Multi-Player Economy Tests
1. **Trade Route Value**: Calculate optimal trade configurations  
2. **Specialization Strategy**: Test pure specialization vs diversification
3. **Economic Warfare**: Test resource denial strategies
4. **Scaling Penalties**: Verify action cost scaling with empire size

## Success Metrics for Balance Testing

### Resource Economy
- [ ] No single planet type dominates all strategies
- [ ] All ship types have viable maintenance-to-effectiveness ratios
- [ ] Research production supports reasonable technology progression
- [ ] Resource storage limits create meaningful strategic decisions

### Combat System
- [ ] No ship type wins >70% against all others
- [ ] Fleet composition matters more than pure numbers
- [ ] Experience bonuses provide advantage without being overpowered
- [ ] Technology progression feels meaningful and balanced

### Strategic Depth
- [ ] Multiple viable strategies for empire development
- [ ] Specialization has clear trade-offs and benefits
- [ ] Diplomatic options provide real strategic value
- [ ] Economic and military power scale appropriately

## Next Steps

1. **Start Testing Environment** - Initialize game state with test players
2. **Run Economic Simulations** - Test resource flows over multiple turns
3. **Combat Scenario Testing** - Create standardized battle scenarios
4. **Multi-Player Interactions** - Test with 2-4 player scenarios
5. **Document Findings** - Record all balance issues and recommended adjustments
