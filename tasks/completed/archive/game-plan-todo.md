#### Core Commands Implementation
- [ ] Empire management commands (status, planets, resources)
- [ ] Fleet control commands (move, attack, formations)
- [ ] Diplomacy commands (relations, negotiate, trade)
- [ ] Construction commands (build, colonize, specialize)
- [ ] Information commands (scan, help, history)

#### Testing & Refinement
- [ ] Command validation and error handling
- [ ] Multi-user testing scenarios
- [ ] Performance testing with multiple concurrent sessions

### PHASE 3: Enhanced Web Client (2-3 weeks)

#### React Component Development

  - Resource monitoring widgets
  - Fleet status displays
  - Planet management panels
- [ ] **MapComponent.js** - Galaxy visualization
  - Sector exploration display
  - Fleet movement visualization
  - Territory control indicators

#### Real-time Features
- [ ] WebSocket integration for live updates
- [ ] Notification system for critical events
- [ ] Session persistence and reconnection handling

#### User Experience Enhancements
- [ ] Responsive design for mobile devices
- [ ] Accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- [ ] Tutorial system integration

### PHASE 4: Playtesting & Refinement (2-3 weeks)

#### Game Balance Testing
- [ ] Single-player testing scenarios
- [ ] Small group multiplayer testing (5-10 players)
- [ ] Large-scale testing (20+ players)
- [ ] Performance optimization under load

#### User Experience Testing
- [ ] New player onboarding flow
- [ ] Command usability and intuitiveness
- [ ] Game pacing and turn duration analysis
- [ ] Mobile device compatibility testing

#### Bug Fixes & Optimization
- [ ] Address issues identified during testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security audit and hardening
- [ ] Documentation updates based on testing feedback

### PHASE 5: Website & Polish (2-3 weeks)

#### Marketing Website
- [ ] Landing page with game overview
- [ ] Player registration and onboarding
- [ ] Community features (forums, leaderboards)
- [ ] Documentation and help system

#### Production Deployment
- [ ] Production server setup and configuration
- [ ] Database optimization for production load
- [ ] Monitoring and logging implementation
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery procedures

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Complete When:
- All 5 game logic services implemented and tested
- API routes fully functional with game mechanics
- Database operations working correctly
- Basic multiplayer functionality operational

### Phase 2 Complete When:
- Terminal client can execute all core commands
- Real-time updates working via WebSocket
- Multi-user sessions stable and performant

### Phase 3 Complete When:
- Web interface provides full game functionality
- Responsive design works on all devices
- Tutorial system guides new players effectively

### Overall Project Success:
- 50+ concurrent players can play simultaneously
- Game mechanics are balanced and engaging
- New player onboarding is smooth and intuitive
- Performance meets production requirements

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Game Balance**: Complex mechanics may require extensive tuning
- **Performance**: Real-time updates for many players may strain resources
- **User Adoption**: Terminal interface may have learning curve

### Mitigation Strategies
- Early and frequent playtesting with incremental improvements
- Load testing and performance monitoring throughout development
- Comprehensive tutorial system and documentation
- Gradual rollout with small player groups initially

## Next Steps for Review

1. **Validate Technical Approach**: Confirm the 5 game logic services cover all necessary mechanics
2. **Timeline Approval**: Adjust timeline based on available development resources
3. **Priority Adjustments**: Reorder tasks based on business priorities
4. **Resource Allocation**: Identify any additional tools or team members needed

## Estimated Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 2-3 weeks (Critical - enables all other phases)
- **Phase 2**: 1-2 weeks (Terminal client)
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 weeks (Web client enhancement)
- **Phase 4**: 2-3 weeks (Testing and refinement)
- **Phase 5**: 2-3 weeks (Production polish)

**Total Estimated Duration**: 9-14 weeks to full production deployment
