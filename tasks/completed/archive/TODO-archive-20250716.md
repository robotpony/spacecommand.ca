# Project Setup Tasks

## Infrastructure Setup Phase

### Core Project Setup
- [x] Initialize Node.js project with npm init
- [x] Set up basic Express server structure in `bin/server.js`
- [x] Create React frontend scaffolding in `src/client/`
- [x] Add development infrastructure (.gitignore, basic file structure)
- [x] Set up Jest testing framework

### Directory Structure
- [x] Create `src/server/` for Express server components
- [x] Create `src/client/` for React frontend components
- [x] Create `src/shared/` for shared utilities/types
- [x] Create `tests/` directory for test files

### Documentation
- [ ] Create basic README.md with project overview
- [ ] Create DESIGN.md for overall design rules

## Notes
- Game logic and RESTful API endpoints will be designed separately after infrastructure setup
- Focus on getting foundational project structure ready for design phase
- Keep all changes simple and minimal

## Review Section

### Completed Infrastructure Setup
- ✅ **Node.js Project**: Initialized with package.json, Express server, and React frontend
- ✅ **Server**: Basic Express server at `bin/server.js` with health check and API endpoints
- ✅ **Frontend**: React app scaffolding using CDN links for development simplicity
- ✅ **Testing**: Jest framework with supertest for HTTP endpoint testing
- ✅ **Development**: .gitignore and proper directory structure created

### Project Structure Created
```

```

### Server Capabilities
- Serves React app at `/` 
- API status endpoint at `/api/status`
- Health check at `/health`
- Static file serving for client assets

### Testing Status
- All tests passing (3/3)
- HTTP endpoint testing configured
- Ready for additional test development

### Next Steps
Project is ready for game design implementation. The infrastructure supports:
- RESTful API development in `src/server/`
- React component development in `src/client/`
- Shared utilities in `src/shared/`
- Comprehensive testing with Jest
