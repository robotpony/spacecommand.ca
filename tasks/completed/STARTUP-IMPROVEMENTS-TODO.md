## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Start Game Testing Environment
```bash
npm start          # Start main server on localhost:3000
npm run terminal   # Launch terminal client for testing
node bin/game-init.js  # Initialize game state if needed
```

### 2. Create Test Scenarios
- **Single player walkthrough**: Complete empire setup → planet colonization → fleet combat → diplomacy
- **Multi-player combat scenarios**: Various fleet compositions and battle conditions
- **Resource economy balance tests**: Monitor resource flows and identify bottlenecks
- **Diplomatic interaction tests**: Test proposal system, agreements, and trade routes

### 3. Performance Baseline Measurement
- Measure current API response times across all endpoints
- Test with multiple concurrent users (start with 5-10, scale up)
- Profile memory usage patterns during extended gameplay
- Identify optimization opportunities

## Success Criteria

### Game Balance
- [ ] No dominant strategies in combat - all ship types viable
- [ ] All planet specializations provide meaningful benefits
- [ ] Economic growth curves feel balanced and engaging
- [ ] Diplomatic options provide real strategic value
- [ ] Technology progression feels rewarding

### Performance Targets
- [ ] API response times average < 200ms
- [ ] System supports 50+ concurrent users without degradation
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable over extended sessions
- [ ] Database queries execute efficiently under load
- [ ] Client interfaces remain responsive during peak usage

### User Experience
- [ ] New player onboarding is smooth and informative
- [ ] Command interface is intuitive and discoverable
- [ ] Error messages are helpful and actionable
- [ ] Game progression feels engaging and rewarding
- [ ] Multi-player interactions are fun and strategic

## Technical Infrastructure Status ✅

### Completed Systems
- **Phase 1**: Complete server architecture with database, API, and game logic
- **Phase 2**: Node.js terminal REPL client with full game functionality  
- **Phase 3**: Browser-based web REPL client with feature parity
- **Security**: Production-ready authentication, CSRF protection, input sanitization
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis caching, migrations, and seeds

### Available Commands
```bash
npm start              # Production server
npm run dev            # Development server with hot reload
npm run terminal       # Terminal client
npm test               # Run test suite
node bin/game-init.js  # Initialize game state
node bin/turn-processor.js  # Process turn advancement
```

## Risk Assessment
