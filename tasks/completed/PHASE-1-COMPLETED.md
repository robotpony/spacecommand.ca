# Phase 1: Server Architecture - COMPLETED ✅

**Completed**: 2025-07-18  
**Duration**: ~3 days  
**Status**: Production Ready

## Overview
Built complete server infrastructure with sophisticated game mechanics, security features, and RESTful API endpoints.

## Key Achievements

### ✅ Database Layer
- PostgreSQL with connection pooling and health checks
- Redis session management with automatic cleanup
- 9 migration files with proper indexes and foreign keys
- BaseModel class with comprehensive CRUD operations
- Database seeding system for initial data

### ✅ Game Logic Services
- **TurnManager**: 24-hour turn cycles with action points
- **ResourceCalculator**: Production/consumption with building bonuses
- **CombatResolver**: Battle resolution with morale and experience
- **DiplomacyProcessor**: Trust levels, proposals, trade routes
- **TerritoryExpansion**: Exploration and colonization mechanics
- **GameBalanceEngine**: Anti-cheat and validation systems

### ✅ RESTful API (30+ endpoints)
- Authentication system with JWT and Redis sessions
- Empire management with resource tracking
- Fleet operations and combat mechanics
- Diplomacy system with proposals and agreements
- Territory exploration and colonization
- Game state management with turn processing

### ✅ Security Hardening
- SQL injection prevention with allowlist validation
- Race condition fixes with atomic action points
- CSRF protection with HMAC tokens
- Resource authorization middleware
- Input sanitization and XSS prevention
- Memory leak fixes in SessionManager

### ✅ Data Models (6 core models)
- **Empire**: Resource management and fleet operations
- **Planet**: Specialization system with 7 planet types
- **Fleet**: Ship composition with 7 unit types
- **Player**: Authentication and session management
- **Combat**: Battle resolution with detailed mechanics
- **Diplomacy**: Inter-player relations and trade

## Files Created
- `src/server/` - Complete server implementation (40+ files)
