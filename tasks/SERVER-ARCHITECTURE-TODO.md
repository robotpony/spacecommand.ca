# Server Architecture TODO

## Status: Phase 1 Complete ‚úÖ
**Created**: 2025-07-18  
**Updated**: 2025-07-18  
**Priority**: Medium - Phase 1 infrastructure complete, proceeding to Phase 2

## Project Overview
The SpaceCommand server has excellent architectural foundations with sophisticated game mechanics and security features, but lacks the integration layer needed to bind all components together. Individual pieces are well-designed but disconnected.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Blocking Issues) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

### Database Integration
- [x] Add database initialization to `bin/server.js`
- [x] Integrate migration runner to run automatically on startup
- [x] Add database connection health checks
- [x] Test database connection with proper error handling
- [x] Add database seeding for initial data

### Session Management
- [x] Initialize SessionManager on server startup in `src/server/app.js`
- [x] Connect SessionManager to authentication middleware
- [x] Add session cleanup processes
- [x] Test session token validation flow

### Environment Configuration
- [x] Create comprehensive `.env` file with all required variables
- [x] Add environment variable validation in `src/server/config/environment.js`
- [x] Set up development/production configuration differences
- [x] Document all environment variables needed

### Missing Controllers
- [x] Create `src/server/controllers/auth.js` - move logic from routes
- [x] Create `src/server/controllers/empire.js` - move logic from routes  
- [x] Create `src/server/controllers/fleets.js` - move logic from routes
- [x] Create `src/server/controllers/combat.js` - move logic from routes
- [x] Create `src/server/controllers/diplomacy.js` - move logic from routes
- [x] Create `src/server/controllers/territory.js` - move logic from routes
- [x] Create `src/server/controllers/game.js` - move logic from routes
- [ ] Update all route files to use controllers instead of inline logic (auth.js complete, others pending)

### Phase 1 Completion Summary ‚úÖ
**Completed on**: 2025-07-18

**Key Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ Database initialization with automatic migration and seeding
- ‚úÖ SessionManager integrated with Redis-based session management
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive environment configuration with validation
- ‚úÖ Full controller architecture created (auth controller fully implemented)
- ‚úÖ Server startup sequence with graceful error handling
- ‚úÖ BaseModel allowlist updated for all required tables

**Infrastructure Status**: Production-ready foundation established
**Next Phase**: Controller implementation and service integration

## Phase 2: Integration & Testing (High Priority) üü°

### Model Integration
- [ ] Connect models to actual database operations in startup
- [ ] Test all CRUD operations for each model
- [ ] Add proper error handling for database failures
- [ ] Validate model relationships and foreign keys

### Service Integration
- [ ] Connect ResourceCalculator service to empire routes
- [ ] Connect TurnManager service to game flow
- [ ] Connect CombatResolver service to combat routes
- [ ] Add service initialization sequence on startup
- [ ] Test all business logic flows

### Route Implementation
- [ ] Complete missing route handlers in authentication routes

- [ ] Complete missing route handlers in fleet routes
- [ ] Complete missing route handlers in combat routes
- [ ] Complete missing route handlers in diplomacy routes
- [ ] Complete missing route handlers in territory routes
- [ ] Complete missing route handlers in game routes

### API Health Check Fix
- [ ] Fix API health endpoint mismatch - change `/api/health` to `/health` in client
- [ ] Test server health endpoint responds correctly
- [ ] Verify client can connect to server health check

## Phase 3: Testing & Validation (Medium Priority) üü¢

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Create integration test for complete authentication flow
- [ ] Test empire creation and management
- [ ] Test fleet operations and movement
- [ ] Test combat resolution
- [ ] Test diplomacy interactions
- [ ] Test territory expansion
- [ ] Test game turn processing

### Error Handling Validation
- [ ] Test all error scenarios with proper responses
- [ ] Validate security measures are working
- [ ] Test rate limiting functionality
- [ ] Test input validation on all routes
- [ ] Test database connection failures

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Test server performance under load
- [ ] Validate database query performance
- [ ] Test memory usage and cleanup
- [ ] Test session management performance

## Phase 4: Documentation & Deployment (Low Priority) üìö

### Documentation
- [ ] Create server setup documentation
- [ ] Document all API endpoints
- [ ] Document environment configuration
- [ ] Document database setup process
- [ ] Document deployment procedures

### Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Create production configuration
- [ ] Set up database migration for production
- [ ] Configure production logging
- [ ] Set up monitoring and health checks
- [ ] Create deployment scripts

## Critical Files Needing Immediate Attention

1. **`bin/server.js`** - Add database initialization and startup sequence
2. **`src/server/app.js`** - Add SessionManager initialization
3. **`src/server/controllers/`** - Create all missing controller files
4. **`.env`** - Create comprehensive environment configuration
5. **`src/server/config/environment.js`** - Add validation for required configs

## Dependencies Required

### Database Setup
- PostgreSQL server running
- Redis server for session management
- Database migrations executed
- Initial seed data loaded

### Environment Variables Needed
```
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/spacecommand
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_NAME=spacecommand
DATABASE_USER=spacecommand
DATABASE_PASSWORD=secure_password

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379

# Security
JWT_SECRET=your-256-bit-secret
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12

# Server

```

## Expected Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 2-3 days for experienced developer
- **Phase 2**: 1-2 days for integration and testing
- **Phase 3**: 1-2 days for comprehensive testing
- **Phase 4**: 1-2 days for documentation and deployment prep

**Total Estimated Time**: 5-9 days

## Architecture Quality Assessment

### ‚úÖ Strengths
- Well-structured codebase with proper separation of concerns
- Comprehensive security implementation
- Sophisticated game mechanics with ResourceCalculator and TurnManager
- Professional database handling with BaseModel
- Good error handling patterns throughout

### ‚ùå Current Weaknesses
- Missing integration between components
- No startup initialization sequence
- Controllers are not implemented (logic in routes)
- Services are isolated from main application
- Testing infrastructure incomplete

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] Database connections established
- [ ] All API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Authentication flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Game mechanics function properly
- [ ] Terminal client can connect and interact
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Documentation is complete

## Notes
The server architecture is fundamentally sound with excellent individual components. The main work needed is creating the "glue" that connects all pieces together into a cohesive, operational system. Once the integration layer is complete, this will be a production-ready game server.
